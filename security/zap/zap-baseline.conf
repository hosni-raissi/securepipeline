# ZAP Baseline Scan Configuration
# This is a quick passive scan for common vulnerabilities

# Ignore these alert types (use with caution)
# Format: ALERT_ID\tURL_REGEX\tPARAMETER\tCWE_ID\tWASC_ID

# Example ignores (customize based on your needs):
# 10021	.*	.*	.*	.*	# Ignore X-Content-Type-Options header missing (if you handle it differently)

# Rules:
# - Each line represents one rule
# - Use tabs to separate fields
# - Alert ID can be found in ZAP reports
# - URL regex matches the endpoint
# - Use .* for wildcards

# No ignores by default - fail on all findings
